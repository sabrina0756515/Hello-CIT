<center><h1> Conituning 10 stages of a relationship</h1></center>
<center><h2> This is the coming apart phase so if your going through this stage do not worry! Well I mean yes worry but these stages arn't always stages. Most relationship go all over these stages.<h2></center>
<center><u> 6. Differentiating stage (you take out your stresses on one another "you can save your relationship here")</u></center>
<center><i> 7. Circumscribing stage (communication becomes less and less "Arguments push you farther away from each other")</i></center>
<center><b> 8. Stagnation stage ( relationship is in hot water "ending the relationship")</b></center>
<center><u> 9. Avoiding stage (now your truly separated)"little eye contact or communication"</u></center>
<center><i> 10. Termination stage (there's nothing left to fight for)"spread your wings".</i></center>
if you are going through a tough time right now in your relationship I advise to sit down, and talk to your partner. Communicate with your partner, and tell them you want to save what you worked on. Don't give up, and if the other person does not feel that way no more remember it's ok. Maybe, that person was a lesson. Your future soul mate is around you, and you will find that person to guide you, and meet your needs.
